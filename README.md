# MissileCommand
Created and developed a game of Missile Command on Visual Studios using C#.

Implemented Multitasking using Threading, however still a work in progress as there is no termination of Threads. Uses an excessive amount of Memory.
Mutlithreading is used for every independent rocket that is coming down from the sky as well as user input.

Errors:
  Excessive Memory usage.
  Shots do not have an area of impact to identify that collision has occured.
  No modifications yet to the game in order to make a free play mode.
  Threading works, collision in all cases do not.
